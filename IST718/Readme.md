# IST 718: Time Series Forcasting Real Estate Value

This project was an attempt to utilize time-series forecasting in order to predict future real estate value for investment by a hypotehtical Syracuse University Real Estate Investment Trust. Done in Python using Google Colab, the dataset was based on Zillow's collection of estimated median home values for a single family residence from 1996 to 2019. In total, the dataset represented over 15,000 records in a .csv file. The time-series alogrithm Prophet, develoepd by Facebook for their own internal forecasting purposes, was applied to the dataset after preprocessing in order to gague what future home values would be out to 2021 within California. Ultimately, Prophet identified three zip codes what had the largest positive change in home value that could make ideal investment opportunities.

This project would serve as the inspiration for a similar project at my current workplace. In this case, Prophet was used to forecast future help desk demand out to 2022 in order anticipate greater resource demands and prepare ahead of time, as well as determining whether specific clients were forecasted to place greater demands on technical resources in the future.
