Fallout 4 is a 2015 open world role playing game that is renowned for its sprawing enviornments, deep interactivity, and non-linear storytelling. In particular, quest lines can branch in multiple directions and locations, making the tracking of them rather complex. This served as the inspiration for this project. I would use Microsfot SQL Server Management Studio to build a relational database that would contain all quests, quest rewards, associated characters, and associated locations, providing a comprehensive snapshot of the quest structure of Fallout 4. Views and stored procedures provide flexibility in accessing the database and making routine changes, while a front end built using Microsoft Access allowed for basic data analysis for non-technical users.

Going forward, there were a few different ways this project could be improved. The data entry would prove to be the most tedious part of the project, as it invovled manually entering the values based on what is listed in the Fallout 4 wiki. Knowledge gained from later classes meant that it would have also been possible to web scrape the relevant data - perhaps using BeautifulSoup in Python - into a csv file to import. While Access was the recommended tool to use for front end data analysis, I would much rather make use of a visualization tool such as Microsoft Power BI to not only replicate much of the same function, but provide far greater power and ease of use.
