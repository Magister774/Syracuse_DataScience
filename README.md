# Syracuse_DataScience
This repo is a sample of projects done during my time in the Applied Data Science MS program at Syacuse. These projects run from relational database/data warehouse creation to machine learning powered insights and problem solving. All projects would receive an A upon completion and were used within my graduation portfolio to deomonstrate mastery of course material. Projects include:

IST 659 - Database Administration: Fallout 4 Quest Database (T-SQL/Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio)

IST 707 (formerly IST-565) - Data Analytics: Character Representation and Implications in Marvel Comics (R - Association Rule Mining / Decision Trees)

IST 687 - Intro to Data Science (Group Project): Captial Bikeshare Data Analysis (R - SVM)

IST 718 - Big Data Analytics: Real Estate Value Forecasting for Investment (Python - Prophet Time Series Algorithm)

Some of these projects would serve as inspiration to build on them outside of grad school and work as personal projects. Please check the Current-Project repo for updates if you are interested. Both the IST 687 and IST 718 projects would also serve as inspirations for applying the same concepts to my current workplace in order to demonstrate the value of data science in the managed service provider industry. Details can be found in their repsective folders.
